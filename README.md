# Ahmet TunÃ§ â€” Mechatronics & Control

3rd-year Mechatronics Engineering student (**ranked 1st**) at Istanbul Health and Technology University.  
I build control & embedded systems end-to-end: **modeling â†’ simulation â†’ electronics â†’ firmware â†’ tests â†’ docs**.

- **TÃœBÄ°TAK 2209-B Grantee (Project Lead / PI)** â€” FPGA-based ADCS for CubeSat  
- **President**, Control & Automation Club  
- **Embedded Systems Intern**, Mutusan Electric

## ðŸ”­ Featured Projects
- **FPGA-Based ADCS for CubeSat** â€” reaction wheel, Kalman-based sensor fusion (IMU + magnetometer), PID/MPC; MATLAB/Simulink â†’ HDL/Verilog.
